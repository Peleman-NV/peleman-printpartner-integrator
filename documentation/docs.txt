filters hooks change an existing function - eg. when you want to override something
    apply_filters()
    remove_filter also possible - priority is necessary is originally set
action hooks add new functionality to an existing action
    do_action goes where you what it to happen - add_action is where you define what happens
    add this to the product page: do_action('change_button_function')
    in functions.php, add this: add_action('change_button_function', 'hijack_default_button_functionality', 11)
    (third param is the priority - default is 10 & lower gets run first)
    remove_action and remove_all_actions is also possible - priority is necessary is originally set
